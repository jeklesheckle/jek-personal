recognize matters of opinion or questions with several answers

how do I get people to use this? 
it's free so there's no harm in trying but there is a bit of a hassle in getting "signed up"
why use this instead of independent research?
	-get assists from the foremost experts on things
what about if I lose out on money?
	-what if people could put bounties on things and pay when they are satisfied with a result.
bounties are cool but some research requires advance funding. 
	-I think that can be handled on a per-party basis. If there's someone who wants funding they can request it but that's not really something the site HAS to handle. might be a profit opportunity tho. basically if there is a team ready to work but in need of funding they can just ask for those interested in funding to contact them or redirect to a crowdfunding page

okay this is getting kinda cool but I'm going to need a few hours to work out even a rough design for this. Maybe dedicate a week's time or so and see how we're doing after that. I'm seeing some opportunities for serious monetary flow, which is exciting because I was initially thinking there would be none. at the very least I'll be able to cover expenses for high-quality hosting. 

the addition of expenses does add risks of someone taking the idea. It's cool to be the guy who came up with it but I don't want to be poor if I could have been rich as fuck, so I should take steps to protect the IP.
