The rest of this is mostly mistakes, but /calculator/ is a calculator project I'm working on. It's nothing that's supposed to be impressive, but I kept hitting obstacles OTHER than Rust while trying to make other projects with Rust, so I'm just going to make something that will let me get really good at writing Rust and will in no way strain me regarding other things (decision making, money, mechanical design, hardware). 

The calculator project should let me get a firm grasp on:
- error handling and creation
- becoming familiar with native types (especially compound types, there's a lot o -o)
- rustdoc inline documentation
- beating syntax into my head so I stop having to look it up every month or so

Some other things that are important to me that I'll probably have to create a more for (maybe a particle sim?) are:
- user interfacing and display
- working with multiple threads / asynchronous code
- writing rust for use on microcontrollers
