tried just pyinstaller full_script_v0.py 
    openpyxl module not found error
tried pyinstaller -wF full_script_v0.py --hidden-import openpyxl
    same exact problem. console mentioned it couldn't find hidden import jinja2
tried again same command after pip installing jinja2 and openpyxl
    WORKED, wrote file. Still being rate limited tho.

fuckin with imports to reduce size from 45mb, make sure things still work (else just import the whole libraries)
