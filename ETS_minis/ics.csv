We had apparently started to set up an account with them at some point but had not finished. \nThey have a guy from Georgia who sometimes comes up near DC if we were interested in meeting.

SUMMARY:Outbound call AC General Inc.,,,,,
DESCRIPTION:Called, ran into some trouble with their robot answering machine. Got on the line with a guy who didn't want to give me his name. Mentioned some past business we had and asked if he had time. He seemed to be alright with proceeding with the call. He got another call, put me on hold for a few seconds and then hung up on me. \nDuring the call I was able to figure out they apparently normally do their own sales and don't work with distributors. Perhaps this is a change from what they did in the past?,,,

SUMMARY:Outbound call Time Machines Corp,,,,,
DESCRIPTION:Godfrey picked up on the sales team.\nTime servers, NTP clocks (get time from timeservers POE/Wifi). Good for synchronized clocks. Timeservers are nice for isolated networks that can't contact an outside timeserver. 5% off for 5+, 10+ = 10%. \nThey don't have any kind of partnership discount, just the volume discounts shown above. Seems like we might have trouble using it but maybe if we had a bunch of different customers who needed a pair of timeservers it could work out.,,
