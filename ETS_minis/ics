SUMMARY:Outbound call PROLINE
DESCRIPTION:Val in sales responded to call, sent me over to Bob (her supervisor). \nThey don't have any sort of partner program but we can open an account with them to get perks and discounts on purchases that might increase our margins. \nWe worked for a while to find the order number relating our companies from the RFQ. We had apparently started to set up an account with them at some point but had not finished. \nThey have a guy from Georgia who sometimes comes up near DC if we were interested in meeting.

SUMMARY:Outbound call AC General Inc.
DESCRIPTION:Called, ran into some trouble with their robot answering machine. Got on the line with a guy who didn't want to give me his name. Mentioned some past business we had and asked if he had time. He seemed to be alright with proceeding with the call. He got another call, put me on hold for a few seconds and then hung up on me. \nDuring the call I was able to figure out they apparently normally do their own sales and don't work with distributors. Perhaps this is a change from what they did in the past?

SUMMARY:Outbound call Time Machines Corp
DESCRIPTION:Godfrey picked up on the sales team.\nTime servers, NTP clocks (get time from timeservers POE/Wifi). Good for synchronized clocks. Timeservers are nice for isolated networks that can't contact an outside timeserver. 5% off for 5+, 10+ = 10%. \nThey don't have any kind of partnership discount, just the volume discounts shown above. Seems like we might have trouble using it but maybe if we had a bunch of different customers who needed a pair of timeservers it could work out.

SUMMARY:Outbound call Amtron Technology Inc
DESCRIPTION:Got an operator of some kind who directed me to Eddie. He thought I was some sort of salesperson and tried to shoulder me off. I explained that our company is essentially a customer and he asked for a quote number, which I was able to provide. Unfortunately, he was quite unwilling to provide and information or help at all, and said "I don't think I'm paid to provide any of that kind of information". I saw that it wasn't going to be worth my time and politely allowed him to end the call.\nTheir website smells bad.
