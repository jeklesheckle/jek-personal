the plan is to make a basic shitter app with ads. The app should be
half decent but low effort. Something like a tap platformer.

ideas:
-target tapper:
    > tap targets, avoid tapping non-targets
    > movement is "forward" camera is "first person" but no turning
    > randomly generated, gets faster until user fails, keeping score
      of targets tapped.

-don't stop falling:
  > like the classic that normally uses the accelerometer, but this
    time it's just your finger. track position of user finger and
    move them down generated obstacles. increase speed until failure

-beat up a buddy:
  > like that thing on addictinggames ages ago
  > basically just make it using a game engine like unity
  > features of the engine correspond to tools to attack the buddy

-literally just VR passthrough:
  > just presents camera data to VR you
  > might add picture taking / recording idk
